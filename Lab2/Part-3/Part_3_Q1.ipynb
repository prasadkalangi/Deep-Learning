They arrived at Bill's home first and Mark was invited in for a Coke and to watch some television. The afternoon passed happily with a few laughs and some small talk, then Mark went home.

They ended up in the same high school where they sometimes saw and talked with each other over the years. At last just three weeks before they finished high school, Bill asked Mark if they could talk. Bill asked Mark if he still remembered the day years ago when they had first met. \"Did you ever think why I was carrying so many things home that day?\" asked Bill. \"You see, I cleaned out my locker because I didn't want to leave anything for anyone else. I had put away some of my mother's sleeping pills and I was going home to kill myself.

After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\"},\n","  {'qas': [{'question': \"Which film featured Destiny's Child's first major single?\",\n","     'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90a9',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"For which song, did Destiny's Child take home the grammy award for best R&B performance?\",\n","     'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ab',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '\"Say My Name\"', 'answer_start': 848}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Who did Beyonce record with for the movie \"The Best Man?\"',\n","     'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ac',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"Beyonce's group changed their name to Destiny's Child in what year?\",\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9677',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '1996', 'answer_start': 51}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"The name Destiny's Child was based on a quote in which book of the Bible?\",\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9678',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah', 'answer_start': 85}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Debut song, \"Killing Time\" was featured on what movie\\'s sound track?',\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9679',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'What song won Best R&B Performance in the 43 Annual Grammy Awards?',\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967a',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Say My Name', 'answer_start': 849}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'What singer did Beyonce record a song with for the movie, \\'\\'The Best Man\"?',\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967b',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"Where did Destiny's Child get their name from?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830f9',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah.', 'answer_start': 85}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"Destiny's Child song, Killing Time, was included in which film's soundtrack?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fa',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black.', 'answer_start': 215}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"What was Destiny's Child's first major song hit?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fb',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'No, No, No', 'answer_start': 330}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"When did Destiny's Child release their second album?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fc',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '1999', 'answer_start': 688}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Who did Beyoncé sing a duet with for \"The Best Man\" film?',\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fd',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}],\n","     'is_impossible': False}],\n","   'context': 'The group changed their name to Destiny\\'s Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.

Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé\\'s alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"\\'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\". The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift\\'s \"You Belong with Me\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift\\'s award during her own acceptance speech.

This made her the first woman in the chart\\'s history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyoncé received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album\\'s unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\". The single \"Drunk in Love\", featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, after much speculation in the weeks before, Beyoncé and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour. It served as the couple\\'s first co-headlining stadium tour together. On August 24, 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Knowles also took home three competitive awards: Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for \"Pretty Hurts\", as well as best collaboration for \"Drunk in Love\". In November, Forbes reported that Beyoncé was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row—earning $115 million in the year, more than double her earnings in 2013.

In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers\\' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyoncé said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was \"finding the best qualities in every human being.\" With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls.
